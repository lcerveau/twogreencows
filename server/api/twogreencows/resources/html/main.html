    <h1>Why we are here?</h1>
    <p> Growing pot is certainly a very pleasant activity. Not because of the end result (and we all know there are various lawws around the topic), but because it teaches you how to grow. There are many things to learn and it's far from easy. Anyone who goes into the topic learns a lot about growing in general: water, acidity, sickness, cdeficit, natrium, lights, wavelength... Pick one topic it will be here!</p>
    <p>A very common pattern is to grow weed in order to also grow other fruits or vegerables. Sure it is not so difficult to plant radis or courgette, but it can really be harder to get passion fruits or lemons. And if you have no room and need hydroponics then things become more complicated</p>
    <p> Many web sites exists around pot growing providing advices and having blogs forums. But for now I haven't found one source where I could learn from the collective intelligence. Let's take an example: I can easily go and find many pages describing carences, but still I am puzzled on what I need to do. Azote or Zinc deficiency? Damn the yellow variants can make it difficult, and my plant is still dying.

    <h1>What we will do?</h1>
    <p>There are many technical means to help on this path. And as those develop why not use them to improve our grow knowledge. After all clever Machine Learning based stacks are able to recognize a car model or a skin problem, so they should be able to diagnostic a plant problem?</p>
    <p>Observation is also helpful. Looking at all those weed forums, there is always the need to look at more: Indica, Sativa, Rudalis. How to remember those names? Wich size? Which leaves? Is it Mildew or Oidum? A sickness or a deficiency?So many types and information to get and most of all so many type of information where answers need to be found. </p>
    <p>Now technical means, the "so called Artificial intellgence" can help here and through a simple means. It provides way to learn from results. Sometimes with a more or less accuracy, but result can be good. And knowledge is something that is done incrementally and get build little by little. So the main part is why not learn through the collective experience assisted with some technical means?"</p>p
    <p>Will it work? No certaintly but certainly worth to be tried. At the worst this is the biggest databank of weed images and people can browse through them. And simply this, I wish I had myself in some occasion</p>

    <h1>Privacy is respect</h1>
    <p>Dealing with weed is always difficult. Is it legal or not? Even me I do not know what I am doing. Promotion of something illegal, lesson for the future and all home grow plants (not only weed), preventing some traffic in bad suburbs, gather technical information?</p>
    </p>One thing is sure:collective intelligence requires data and as such it will rely on user uploading their data. So I guarantee <strong>we won't try to know who you are!</strong>. If you upload a picture we'll make sure we remove any hidden tag that could reveal private information (either delete, truncate or anonymized), we won't track your IP address, you will not need an account. And if oen day we do advertising (because maintaining the site would cost too much), then we'll look on how to make it in a proper way.</p>
    <p>And as such it will be reciprocical. You should never know who I am
    <p>Of course, some people would ask: but what guarantee it? To be sincere, I can not provide proof.
